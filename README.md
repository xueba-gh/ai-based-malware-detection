# AI-Based Network Malware Analyzer

This project is an AI-based tool for analyzing network traffic captured in PCAP files to detect potential malware using a pre-trained SVM model.

## Features

- Upload and analyze PCAP files
- Predict whether network traffic is malicious or benign
- Display prediction confidence and feature importance
- Track and display statistics on predictions and user visits

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malware-analyzer.git
   cd malware-analyzer
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Ensure your pre-trained SVM model file (`malcare.pkl`) is in the `models/` directory.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```
streamlit run main.py
```

The application will start and can be accessed in your web browser at `localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1. Upload a PCAP file using the file uploader in the web interface.
2. The application will analyze the file and provide a prediction on whether the traffic is malicious or benign.
3. The confidence of the prediction and feature importance will be displayed.
4. Statistics about predictions and user visits can be viewed in the sidebar.

## Note

This is a simplified example for educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would need to:

1. Implement more sophisticated feature extraction from the PCAP files.
2. Regularly update the model to keep up with new types of malware.
3. Implement additional security measures for handling potentially malicious files.
4. Use a more robust database solution for production environments.
